** Tribes (12 Earthly <<Branches>>)
 - 12 months as zodiac,
 - hours (x2) of a day and a night.
 - cycle of 12 years for 
 - 12 Earthly Branches, 12 Heavenly Stems
 - 12 * 5 = 60 to combine element and tribe.
   so every 60 "year" is a new cycle.

 "The 7 crystal systems consist of 32 crystal classes (corresponding to the
  32 crystallographic point groups) as shown in the following table:"
 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_system#In_four-dimensional_space
 23 (minus one?) crystal spaces in 4F, each having 10 values
 (4 edge length + 6 interaxial angles), sefirot
 23rd (or 1st) letter must be the Space.
 230 space groups (231?) ie. 22 letters x 21 letters = 462 (eliminate mirrors, 231)
