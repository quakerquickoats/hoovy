* Quotes
"when we develop our own Lisp, we are essentially on a highly egocentric
 endeavor: the quest for a language perfect for us and only for us, which
 may be found only if we gain a deep understanding of our true self,
 completely disregarding the outside world. Programming Lisp, and in Lisp,
 is thus a highly introspective journey."

Instead, is more a philosophy of music, even more so a musical process:
grabbing musical bits and pieces everywhere, and making a happy melting
pot out of those influences, in a way which is specific to each Jazz
musician.

Life doesn't bear thinking about.
Programming and Lisp are reasonably effective distractions.
Music too. Use them to live out your life in peace.
Underneath this skin, I wait to hear my name again.

  Every money reward has a price beyond the financial fee you can see and
  count. Accepting that is critical.
  Scott Adams once wrote: “One of the best pieces of advice I’ve ever
  heard goes something like this:
  If you want success, figure out the price, then pay it. It sounds
  trivial and obvious, but if you unpack the idea it has extraordinary
  power.”
  Wonderful money advice.

  "<Pixel_Outlaw> You either get the ugly on the programmer side or the
   CPU side. The "beautiful" is always on the opposite end."
