   whatcha need? summore feed ?
   bleeder burreeeeto torpeeedo 
   skin ur knees ask fer sum please
   mosquito

   all these folk
   keyboard stroke

** 
   feeling great
   like i am my own state
   make mistakes
   cant even relate
   what it takes
   to vegetate

** 
   going fast feelin harassed
   catch a meal of banana peel
   ride your deal its past ur last
   just im e-laastic dont need an appeal

** 
   what did you see, sir? why did you seize her
   im a believ-er just tryin to free her

   sorry to run past miss but i cant last in this
   place is way too fast everyones a spaz
   pass me my glass dont step on my glasses
   ate too much molasses cant see passed this
   time and money for your everlasting
   overmassing encumbered totally fasting
   mail me your last address see if we cant trap this
   staaap this, fero-cious, jurassic time-lapse into the paaast-ness
   mortal blur what happ-enned its way too fast-man
   just relax-ing boulder-dashing
   well i cant sing but have a bashing
   of mad things but more or less rad things
   only adjectives and sad fact things
   over-acting and satisfacting
   establishing a more compact spin
